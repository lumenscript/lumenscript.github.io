<p>Churches put out Advent wreaths during Advent, the time when we prepare ourselves for The Nativity of the Lord, or Christmas. You can have it in your house, too, and gather around it as a family to say prayers and light the candles. It is a good way to remember the real reason for the season.<br>
The Advent Wreath has symbols that remind us who we are waiting for: Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Advent wreath is made up of evergreen branches, symbolizing everlasting life that God gives us.</li>
<li>It is shaped in a circle, symbolizing that God is eternal and has no beginning and no end.</li>
<li>It has purple colors, symbolizing penance. It has four candles, for the four weeks of Advent.</li>
<li>It sometimes has a fifth white candle in the center, to light on Christmas.<br>
Each week, we light another candle, and as the Advent wreath gets brighter, and Christmas gets closer, we are reminded that Jesus, the light of the world, is almost here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-the-prophets-candle">1. The Prophets’ Candle</h3>
<ul>
<li>And again Isaiah says: “The root of Jesse shall come, raised up to rule the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.” Rom 15:12</li>
<li>This candle symbolizes hope. The prophets gave messages to the people, giving them hope that God will fulfill his promise and send us a Savior. That Savior is Jesus.</li>
<li>Lord God, as we light this candle of hope, we remember the hope that the prophets brought to your people. Prepare our hearts for the coming of your Son. Let us hope for eternal life, trusting that you will give us all the grace we need to reach heaven.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-bethlehem-candle">2. The Bethlehem Candle</h3>
<ul>
<li>“A voice of one crying out in the desert: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The winding roads shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’” Lk 3:4-6</li>
<li>This candle symbolizes faith. Mary and Joseph had to travel to Bethlehem. It was hard. But they had faith that, no matter how bumpy the journey of life was, God would always be there to make things work out for the better.</li>
<li>Lord God, as we light this candle of faith, we remember the faith that Mary and Joseph had during their journey to Bethlehem. Increase our faith during our journey to heaven. Help us fill the valleys in our souls with prayers and good works. Help us level the mountains and hills of our sins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-the-shepherds-candle">3. The Shepherds’ Candle</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy.” Lk 2:10</li>
<li>This candle symbolizes joy. It is rose, or pink, because it is lit on Gaudete Sunday, which means “rejoice”. We rejoice just like the shepherds rejoiced when they heard that the long-awaited Messiah had finally come. We are halfway to Christmas, and we know that when Jesus is born, the whole world should rejoice.</li>
<li>Lord God, as we light this candle of joy, we remember the joy of the shepherds when they saw Baby Jesus, the Lord. Help us put you, the source of joy, in the center of everything we do so we can live a joyful life and share that joy with others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-the-angels-candle">4. The Angels’ Candle</h3>
<ul>
<li>And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: “Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” Lk 2: 13-14</li>
<li>This candle symbolizes peace. An angel announced the coming of Jesus, the Prince of Peace. The world, troubled by sin and death for so long, is finally granted the peace of knowing that the Son of God has come as our Savior.</li>
<li>Lord God, as we light this candle of peace, we remember the angel’s message of peace to the world. Grant us your peace. Help us be an agent of peace by serving others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="christs-candle-on-christmas">Christ’s Candle on Christmas</h3>
<ul>
<li>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. Jn 3:16</li>
<li>Another name for Jesus is Emmanuel, which means “God is with us”. Jesus is the best gift of all. This is what we celebrate on Christmas. He brings hope, faith, joy, and peace.</li>
<li>Lord God, as we light this Christmas Candle, we remember the amazing day when your Son came to earth as a tiny baby. Thank you, Jesus, for coming to live with us, love us, and teach us the best way to get to heaven.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blessing-of-the-advent-wreath">Blessing of the Advent Wreath</h3>
<p>At the beginning of Advent, your family can get together and pray the Blessing of the Advent Wreath:</p>
<p>All make the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Leader: Our help is in the name of the Lord.<br>
Response (R/.) Who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Leader: A Reading from the book of Isaiah:
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; Upon those who lived in a land of gloom a light has shone. You have brought them abundant joy and great rejoicing; They rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest, as they exult when dividing the spoils. Is 9: 1-2<br>
For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests. They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace. His dominion is vast and forever peaceful, upon David’s throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this! Is 9: 5-6</p>
<p>Leader: The Word of the Lord.<br>
R/. Thanks be to God.</p>
<p>With hands joined, the leader says:<br>
Lord our God,
we praise you for your Son, Jesus Christ:
he is Emmanuel, the hope of the peoples,
he is the wisdom that teaches and guides us,
he is the Savior of every nation.
Lord God,
let your blessing come upon us
as we light the candles of this wreath.
May the wreath and its light
be a sign of Christ’s promise to bring us salvation.
May he come quickly and not delay.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.<br>
R/. Amen.</p>
<p>The blessing may conclude with a verse from the song
“O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”</p>
