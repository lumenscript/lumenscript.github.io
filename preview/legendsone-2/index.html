            <p><em>By Vy Nguyen</em></p>
<h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>
<p>The warden’s roar echoed down the hallway. He was angry. A great beast like himself should not be a prisoner. Tight chains pulled down on his arms and legs. He could barely move.</p>
<p>Footsteps sounded on the stone floor. The warden roared. He recognized the scent of his captor.</p>
<p>“Welcome, my friend,” said the low voice. “Are you uncomfortable? No worries. I will set you free soon enough.”</p>
<p>The warden growled. He built up energy within his chest and shot out an explosion of sound waves.</p>
<p>But the sonic boom didn’t blast the Voice away. The sound waves bounced off the floor and walls and made a picture in the warden’s head.</p>
<p>The Voice came from someone who had the form of an Ancient Builder. He wore a cloak and held a staff with a sword’s blade at the end.</p>
<p>The warden moaned. The sword’s crossguard was carved in a familiar shape.</p>
<p>It was shaped like the tendril ears of a warden.</p>
<p>“So, you recognize this,” said the Voice. “Good.”</p>
<p>A sharp chime sounded. High-pitched ringing spread throughout the room.</p>
<p>The warden roared. The sound from the magic sword stabbed his brain like needles. He shook his head wildly, trying to cover his ears.</p>
<p>“Listen closely, beast. This is how it’s going to work.”</p>
<p>The warden yanked on his chains with all his strength. They tore free from the wall.</p>
<p>But the sounds continued to ring in his ears. The warden staggered. He didn’t know which way to run or where to attack. He couldn’t sense anything but the screams.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple, really,” said the Voice. “I tell you what to do, and you do it.”</p>
<p>The warden groaned. All he wanted was to get rid of that piercing sound. He dropped to his knees in pain.</p>
<p>“There are a few castles on the other side of this mountain. I want them destroyed. And you, my friend, will stop anyone who gets in the way.”</p>
<p>The screams from the spell died down. But the warden couldn’t get up from the ground, no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>He couldn’t think clearly. The high-pitched ringing droned on in the back of his head.</p>
<p>“Now, stand up and follow me.”</p>
<p>The warden rose to his feet. He could move again. He tried to run away from the Voice, but the shrieking sound came back.</p>
<p>The warden roared in pain and covered his ears.</p>
<p>“Wrong way, warden,” the Voice said quietly.</p>
<p>The warden groaned. He turned around and the painful sound went away. The Voice was waiting. It ordered him to follow.</p>
<p>“You, and all the others, will learn in time,” said the Voice. “You have no choice but to do as I say.”</p>
<p>He laughed evilly. “I will be the most powerful being in all of Minecraft.”</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<p>“Alex, relax.” Steve leaned back and chomped on his loaf of bread. “We finished the mission and they paid us our diamonds. Stop worrying and enjoy your pork.”</p>
<p>Alex glanced at the tavern bar. Other Builders were buying food and drinks there.</p>
<p>“I’d rather cook my own meals,” Alex told Steve, “like we do when we’re traveling through the wilderness. What if they slip poison in the food?”</p>
<p>Steve blinked. “Then we’ll just drink milk.” He grinned. “But if you don’t want your pork…”</p>
<p>Alex pushed her plate to Steve. He lit up and gobbled down the food.</p>
<p>Alex watched her friend. “Steve…you said we’d be all set after this job. You said it would be our last one.”</p>
<p>Steve looked up, his cheeks bulging. “Yep. That’s good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Alex narrowed her eyes. “You said it would be our last one together.”</p>
<p>Steve stopped, a loaf of bread halfway to his mouth. He lowered his hand. “Well…Alex, the thing is, I don’t need any more diamonds at the moment. I have other plans. And I’m sure you do too.”</p>
<p>Steve wiggled his eyebrows. “I know we make a good team, but there’s more to life than being a mercenary.”</p>
<p>Alex pursed her lips. It was true, allying with Steve paid well. But more than that—Steve was the only person in the world Alex could trust. She wasn’t giving that up so easily.</p>
<p>Alex frowned. “You think this is about diamonds?”</p>
<p>Steve opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Metal armor clattered loudly. Soldiers rushed past, clutching swords and axes.</p>
<p>Alex jumped to her feet. “That’s strange. I didn’t hear any pillager raid horns. Steve, let’s check on the villagers.”</p>
<p>Steve popped out his diamond sword and ran after the soldiers. “In any case, you’re going to wish you filled up your hunger points!” he called back to Alex.</p>
<p>Alex and Steve dashed toward the castle in the middle of the village. Their mouths dropped.</p>
<p>The gate was completely destroyed. Walls had crumbled. Soldiers screamed as a huge black beast threw them across the courtyard. Glowing blue soul wisps bobbed inside the creature’s open rib cage.</p>
<p>“What in the world is that?” Alex cried. She glanced at Steve. His face was pale. That was never a good sign.</p>
<p>“It’s a warden!” he shouted. “What’s it doing above ground?”</p>
<p>The warden smashed down a wall and burst into the castle. The king and his soldiers tried to hack the warden with swords. But one whack from the warden’s arms drove the men into the ground. He cornered the king.</p>
<p>Alex took out her bow and shot an arrow.</p>
<p>“Alex, don’t!” said Steve.</p>
<p>Too late. Alex’s arrow struck the warden’s head. He growled and charged toward them.</p>
<p>“Yikes!” Alex quickly shot another arrow. The warden didn’t seem to get hurt.</p>
<p>Steve pulled her behind an azalea bush. “Shh! The warden’s blind. It follows sound.”</p>
<p>Alex peeked out. The warden stood still, sniffing. His tendril ears waved.</p>
<p>Steve glanced at Alex’s bow. He grinned. “Alex, I know you always hit your target. But this time, try your best to miss.”</p>
<p>Alex drew her bow again. She shot at the wall instead of the warden. The arrow hit the stone. The noise made blue sound waves fly through the air toward the warden.</p>
<p>His tendril ears clicked. The warden turned and ran toward the wall.</p>
<p>Steve looked into the castle. The king and his men were staggering to their feet.</p>
<p>“We have to get them out of the castle,” Steve whispered. “We don’t stand a chance against a warden. Give me the bow. I’ll distract the warden so you and all of the villagers can escape.”</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving you by yourself,” Alex said.</p>
<p>Steve punched her. Alex yelped and dropped the bow. Steve snatched it up from the ground.</p>
<p>“Come on, Alex, I know more about the warden than you do.” He smiled apologetically. “And someone’s gotta tell that king he’s got to surrender.”</p>
<p>Alex crossed her arms. She hated it when Steve wanted to fight solo.</p>
<p>“Be careful,” she finally said. Alex jumped and silently rolled to a pillar. She tiptoed to the broken wall of the castle.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Steve’s arrows luring the warden away from her. Alex jumped into the castle.</p>
<p>“Ah! Who are you?” said a man with a crown.</p>
<p>“Hello, king,” Alex said. There was a proper title to call kings, she just couldn’t remember what it was. Growing up on the streets, there was no one to teach you manners.</p>
<p>“You and your soldiers have to get the villagers out of here,” said Alex. “Keep everyone as quiet as you can.”</p>
<hr>
<p>As soon as Alex helped the civilians evacuate, she hurried back to the courtyard. The sound of Steve’s shouts and the warden’s roars became clearer. A shield shattered. Alex turned the corner.</p>
<p>Her heart dropped. Alex screamed.</p>
<p>The warden swung his arms. Steve was hurled across the courtyard. He slammed into the stone wall and crumpled to the ground.</p>
<p>Alex rushed over, not caring that she was running right into the warden’s attack.</p>
<p>“Steve!” Alex dropped to her knees, desperately feeling for a heartbeat.</p>
<p>The warden growled. He rushed right at them. Alex grabbed her bow from the ground and shot an arrow into the warden’s mouth.</p>
<p>The warden roared in pain. But he kept coming. Alex hastily traded her bow for a sword. She stood in front of Steve, her heart pounding. They were going to die—</p>
<p>The warden stopped. Its eyeless face towered over them. It didn’t move.</p>
<p>Alex’s hand trembled. What was going on? Alex glanced behind the warden.</p>
<p>A dark-cloaked figure stood on top of the wall. He raised a glowing sword. It had blue, curving warden tendrils above its hilt.</p>
<p>Alex’s breath caught in her throat. A hood shadowed the man’s face.</p>
<p>The warden spun around and bounded across the courtyard. He climbed up the wall like a spider. The cloaked man climbed onto the warden’s back. They leapt off the wall and disappeared from view.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Steve groaned and tried to open his eyes. Something was stuck in his mouth. He swallowed. It was crunchy like an apple, but had no taste. A tingling spread throughout his body.</p>
<p>Steve blinked, his vision coming back into focus. He was lying under a tree. Alex was bending over him, worried.</p>
<p>“Did I die?” Steve asked. His voice croaked.</p>
<p>Alex slapped her forehead. “No, Steve. You didn’t die. You wouldn’t be talking to me if you did.”</p>
<p>Steve nodded. Respawning was a myth that most Builders didn’t believe in.</p>
<p>Golden apples, on the other hand, were crafted for their healing properties, and were quite real.</p>
<p>“Hey, thanks for that golden apple, Alex.” Steve slowly sat up. Pain shot up from his side. Steve winced. “Did the villagers—?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Alex. “They escaped.” Alex turned away and began packing their supplies on the mule.</p>
<p>Steve frowned. “I missed something, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“No, Steve,” said Alex. “The king and many of his people really did escape. Would I lie to you about something like that?”</p>
<p>“What happened to the warden?” asked Steve. His side ached furiously.</p>
<p>Alex lowered her head. “He—he burrowed underground after he couldn’t find anyone else to kill.”</p>
<p>Steve bit into another golden apple. “Alex, you know I’m just going to keep bugging you until you tell me what really happened, right?”</p>
<p>Alex groaned. “Fine. There was a man controlling the warden with a magic sword.” Alex started pacing. “I don’t know who he is. I don’t know what he’s planning to do. But I’m going to find out.”</p>
<p>Alex knelt down and touched a trail of trampled dirt. “They just…left, Steve. Right after the warden hit you.” Alex turned away from him. “It was like…they finished what they came to do.”</p>
<p>Steve stared at Alex’s back. He forced a laugh. “Well, obviously, they <em>thought</em> they finished what they came to do. But they didn’t. Because I’m not dead.”</p>
<p>“Do you know who he is?” Alex asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Not a clue.” Steve shrugged. “But I’m not surprised. I have more enemies than I can keep track of.”</p>
<p>Alex went back to packing without another word. Steve clutched his stomach.</p>
<p>Man, his side was <em>really</em> hurting. Steve removed his armor and glanced at the place the warden had struck him.</p>
<p>Steve almost choked on his apple. His side was black and blue.</p>
<p>No, not black and blue with bruises. His skin had turned black with flickering blue lights.</p>
<p>It had turned into sculk. The same fungus that grew in the warden’s corrupted home.</p>
<p>Steve hurriedly put his armor back on as Alex turned around.</p>
<p>“These wardens,” she said, “what else do you know about them?”</p>
<p>Steve opened his mouth. He closed it again. “Not much, actually,” he admitted. “They’ve been deep dark killers for as long as anyone can remember. Purely evil creatures.”</p>
<p>Alex bit her lip. “Don’t say that. Everything spawns for a reason.”</p>
<p>“What about zombies?” Steve pulled a face.</p>
<p>“They used to be Builders like us.” Alex crossed her arms. “You know they were corrupted by the plague.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” said Steve. “It’s not their fault. Okay, what about vexes? Those nasty fairies are one of the worst parts of a raid.”</p>
<p>Alex sighed. “Come on, Steve.” She mounted the mule and beckoned.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Steve winced as he mounted behind Alex. He tried not to think about the sculk growing on his body. Maybe it would come off when he took a bath.</p>
<p>“We’re going to follow the warden’s trail,” said Alex. “That cloaked man looked like bad news.”</p>
<p>“The Warden Master,” Steve said spookily. He grinned. “Good name, huh?”</p>
<p>“If you say so.” Alex flicked the reins, and the mule cantered toward the setting sun.</p>
<p>“It’s almost night. We’re not going to sleep?” asked Steve.</p>
<p>Alex groaned. “Steve, you just slept. I had to carry you all the way outside the city as you slept.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Steve followed the trail of broken trees and trampled dirt with his eyes. It led to a mountain path.</p>
<p>Steve rubbed his chin, trying to remember why the mountains looked familiar. He lit up. “Hey, Alex! An old friend of mine lives in a city just over the mountain. And guess what—he is obsessed with wardens. Maybe he’ll know about the
magic warden sword.”</p>
<p>“Mountain trail sounds good,” said Alex. “Crowded city, not so good.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.” Steve laughed. “I think you’ll like this one.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>
<p>“Why are there so many iron golems?” Alex eyed the tall guards standing in the village.</p>
<p>“My friend likes to be prepared,” said Steve. “I think he has trust issues. Like you.”</p>
<p>Alex crossed her arms. “Better safe than sorry. I always have to give you my stash of golden apples.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I have you to do the worrying for me.” Steve smirked.</p>
<p>Alex rolled her eyes. “Ha, ha. Very funny.”</p>
<p>“And aren’t you glad you have me to protect you?” Steve smiled wider.</p>
<p>Alex punched him.</p>
<p>“Ow!” Steve rubbed his arm. Usually, he would laugh. He and Alex would tease each other all the time. But the tingling pain from his side had spread to his arm.</p>
<p>Alex’s smile dropped as she glanced at Steve. “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Steve blinked. “Oh, uh…no, I’m fine.” He grinned. “I probably deserved that.”</p>
<p>Steve glanced up. “Here we are.” He strode toward a giant gate.</p>
<p>Alex cocked her head. “Steve, this is the palace. We can’t just waltz right in.” Alex slapped her forehead. “And…he just waltzed right in.”</p>
<p>“Halt!” The armored guards pointed their axes at Steve. “No one may enter the palace uninvited.”</p>
<p>“But I am invited,” said Steve. “At least I will be once I ask the king.” Steve took a step.</p>
<p>The guards shoved their weapons at him.</p>
<p>Steve backed up. “Trust me, just tell the king that his old buddy Steve is here for a visit.”</p>
<p>The guards growled. “Are you expecting us to believe that a hobo like you is a friend of the great king?”</p>
<p>“I find that hard to believe myself,” Alex whispered to Steve in a warning voice.</p>
<p>The guards took a step. “Now get out of here before we have to get violent.”</p>
<p>“Steve?” a surprised voice came from inside the castle.</p>
<p>Everyone froze.</p>
<p>“Is that you out there?” A young man walked up behind the guards.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty.” The guards lowered their weapons and bowed.</p>
<p>“Hi there, Reganor.” Steve grinned. “You should probably give your guests a warmer welcome.”</p>
<p>Reganor laughed quietly. “It’s good to see you, Steve.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Alex blinked. Steve and Reganor grasped each other’s forearms.</p>
<p>“See, guys?” Steve told the guards. “Hobos can have great friends.”</p>
<p>Reganor raised his eyebrow at Alex. “And I suppose this is another ‘great friend’ of yours, Steve?”</p>
<p>Alex scratched her arm. She suddenly felt very aware of how dirty and simple her clothes were.</p>
<p>Reganor wore a golden crown and a vibrant red cape. Not to mention he lived in a huge, beautiful castle.</p>
<p>“This is Alex,” Steve said. “When we first met, she was trying to kill me.”</p>
<p>Alex reddened. “It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>Steve grinned. “So yes, she’s a very good friend of mine.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Reganor. He didn’t smile. But he beckoned for the guards to let them through. “Come inside. There’s plenty of extra rooms if you two want to stay the night.”</p>
<p>Alex followed Steve and Reganor into the great hall. She stared at the chandelier hanging like a crystal cloud from the tall ceiling. She had never seen a place like this before.</p>
<p>“Wow,” breathed Alex. She turned to Steve. “How in the world did you two become friends?”</p>
<p>“We were from the same village,” said Steve. “I wanted to travel the world. Reganor here decided to build a name for himself. And boy, did he build it.” Steve tapped Reganor’s crown. “King Reganor.” Steve eyed his friend up and down.
“It makes you sound so old.”</p>
<p>Alex laughed. Then she covered her mouth as Reganor raised his eyebrow.</p>
<p>“So, what brings you back to civilization, Steve?” Reganor led them up the grand staircase.</p>
<p>“Err…” Steve rubbed his side.</p>
<p>Alex narrowed her eyes. Steve had been doing that ever since he had fought the warden. And why was he still wearing his chestplate?</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose it is simply to pay me a visit, is it?” continued Reganor.</p>
<p>“Actually, it is,” said Alex. “Sort of. Steve said you could tell us more about wardens.”</p>
<p>Reganor stopped walking. Complete silence fell.</p>
<p>Steve cleared his throat. “Alex…wardens are not the kind of thing you just <em>mention</em> around here.”</p>
<p>Reganor bowed his head. “It’s okay, Steve.” Reganor turned around to face them.</p>
<p>“Alex, Steve told you we were from the same village. But it wasn’t this village.” Reganor walked out onto a balcony. He stared toward the mountains, past the walls of his kingdom.</p>
<p>“It happened years ago. Some of the Builders had been mining. They awakened a warden by accident. They fled back home, but the wardens followed. Everything we knew was destroyed. Steve and I barely made it out of the village alive.”
Reganor swallowed. “Others weren’t so lucky.”</p>
<p>Steve placed a hand on Reganor’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Reganor closed his eyes. “I promised myself I would build a new home. Nothing would destroy it ever again. So I built this.”</p>
<p>Alex gazed at the high walls around the bright gardens and houses. They were completely covered with wool on the inside.</p>
<p>“We are invisible to the wardens,” Reganor said. “The wool absorbs our sound vibrations. If the wardens ever surface again, they won’t be able to find us.”</p>
<p>Alex coughed. “What if there was someone who was controlling the wardens with magic? Someone who <em>could</em> see?”</p>
<p>Reganor didn’t move. “Who…who would be powerful enough to control a warden?” His voice trembled.</p>
<p>Alex clenched her fists. “We were hoping you would know.” She told him what they had seen in the other kingdom.</p>
<p>Reganor frowned. “This is disturbing news indeed.”</p>
<p>“But now that we’ve warned you about this Warden Master, you won’t be caught off guard,” said Steve. “There’s always a bright side, Reganor.”</p>
<p>Reganor sighed. “Perhaps you are right. And at least now that other king will be busy rebuilding his castle. Before this, he was always threatening to take my land.”</p>
<p>Reganor gazed uncertainly over his prosperous kingdom. “But that rogue warden will only cause more disasters. Especially if it is controlled by a villain.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Reganor,” said Steve. “We’re going to defeat the Warden Master. But we need your help. Is there anything you can tell us about that warden sword?”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know, Steve.” Reganor steadied his breathing. “Wardens are more powerful than any creature in the Overworld. My guess is that a magic sword powerful enough to control wardens can only come from one place.” Reganor looked up.
“The same place the wardens came from.”</p>
<p>“The Ancient City?” guessed Steve.</p>
<p>“No, Steve. Beyond that.” Reganor drew his netherite sword. “If you want answers, we have to open the warden’s portal.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Steve laid his armor down on the bed. The chestplate turned flat, floating above the sheets in its miniature form. It was quite strange how the world of Minecraft worked, but most people didn’t think twice about it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, they would head down to the Ancient City to figure out how to open the portal. They had to be well-rested. Reganor had given Steve and Alex each a fancy room to spend the night in.</p>
<p>Steve stared at his reflection in the looking glass. Was it his imagination, or was the sculk spreading? Sure, the sculk discolored his clothes, but his chest was starting to turn sculk-colored as well.</p>
<p>Usually, golden apples would take away the pain from injuries. But Steve had drained Alex’s supply of golden apples, and his side ached more than ever.</p>
<p>Steve plopped down on his bed and heaved a sigh. He didn’t like to worry, but maybe it was time to start worrying now.</p>
<p>Steve tried to remember what Reganor had told him about wardens and sculk. When a sculk sensor detected any noise, it would alert the warden. The warden would kill whatever made the noise, and the victim’s experience points would drop.
The sculk fungus would then use that stolen energy to grow and spread.</p>
<p>Steve knew sculk corrupted stone blocks and other minerals. But did it corrupt living things too? Did that ever happen before?</p>
<p>Pain throbbed in his chest. Steve suddenly felt very tired. His eyelids dropped.</p>
<p>“STEVE!” shrieked Alex. “What happened to you?”</p>
<p>Steve’s eyes shot open. “What? Nothing. I—I’m changing my clothes. And you forgot to knock.”</p>
<p>Steve grabbed his chestplate. Alex stopped him. “Steve! What were you thinking? Why didn’t you tell me about this?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to worry you.” Steve frowned. “It’s not like it’s going to kill me.”</p>
<p>Alex’s eye twitched. “Steve, you’re turning into a sculk zombie!” she shouted. “What do you mean it’s not going to kill you?”</p>
<p>Steve opened his mouth. He looked down. “Okay, on second thought, this might be serious.”</p>
<p><em>THUD!</em> Books fell to the floor. Reganor stood by the doorway, mouth open. “Steve!” cried Reganor. “What—”</p>
<p>Steve groaned. “The point of giving us bedrooms, Reganor, is to give us a little privacy.” He stomped over and shut the door. “Reganor, Alex, relax. There has to be some kind of cure. We’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>Alex picked up Reganor’s books and placed them on the table. “Reganor, please tell me you know what’s happening to Steve.”</p>
<p>Reganor folded his arms. “I might. But you don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p>“I do,” Steve said.</p>
<p>Reganor shook his head. “I thought you might say that.” He sighed. “After the destruction of our village, I studied the warden extensively. One must know everything there is to know about one’s enemy.”</p>
<p>“Could you talk less fancy?” Steve asked. “It’s making my head hurt.”</p>
<p>“No one knows exactly what the warden is. But one of the legends say…” Reganor trailed off.</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Alex.</p>
<p>Reganor glanced at Steve, then looked away. “They say the first warden was once a Builder…until he got corrupted by sculk.”</p>
<p>Silence fell.</p>
<p>Then Steve burst into laughter. “Come on, Reganor, you don’t really believe that.” Steve raised his arms. “Wardens are shaped completely differently from Builders. Even if my whole body turned into sculk, I still wouldn’t look anything
like a bloodthirsty warden.”</p>
<p>“I <em>didn’t</em> believe the legend, Steve,” said Reganor. “But I didn’t believe that sculk could corrupt flesh either. There’s just so much we don’t know about wardens. They could have abilities we have never heard about.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Alex’s mind raced as she listened to Reganor.</p>
<p>“Okay…let’s just stick with the facts for now,” said Steve. “The warden infected me. The sculk veins are spreading and turning my body into actual sculk…”</p>
<p>Alex groaned. “The facts are just as forbidding as the legend.”</p>
<p>Steve rubbed his head. “Any guess on what the cure might be?”</p>
<p>“The Builders in the Ancient City didn’t have a cure,” said Reganor. He paused. “At least, not on this side of the portal.”</p>
<p>Reganor flipped through an old leather book. “This book was found in the Ancient City. It speaks of an enchanted berry that stops the corruption of sculk. But it is only found in the wardens’ home dimension. Even there it is extremely
rare.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to the other side of the portal?” Alex whispered.</p>
<p>Reganor shut his book. “No, I haven’t. The Ancient City’s portal has been closed for centuries. And for a good reason. It must be extremely dangerous over there, a world overrun with sculk and wardens. It’s impossible to open the
portal, and believe me, I’ve seen people try.”</p>
<p>“But we have to find the antidote!” said Alex. “Steve has a knack with ancient magic. We’ll find a way. Right, Steve?”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>“Steve?” Alex turned.</p>
<p>Steve’s eyes were closed, and he was snoring softly on his bed. Her friend looked exhausted.</p>
<p>Alex pulled the blanket up to his chin. “Oh, Steve,” she whispered. “Why do you always leave me to do all the worrying?”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>
<p>The moonlight shone through the tall glass windows. Alex walked down the quiet hallway. She couldn’t sleep. Exploring the palace kept her mind off things.</p>
<p>The palace was quite impressive, with soaring ceilings, red carpets, and glistening gemstone ores. Reganor was a true Builder. Alex wished she could create something like this. She wondered why Steve never tried.</p>
<p>He knew all the blocks by name, could craft anything from memory, and he was an expert at redstone.</p>
<p>Redstone?</p>
<p>Alex squinted. Was that redstone dust behind that painting? She pushed the canvas aside and uncovered a small hole in the wall. Alex’s eyes grew wide as she spotted a hidden button.</p>
<p><em>Click!</em> She pressed it. The wall rumbled. Pistons pushed the stones aside to reveal a narrow doorway.</p>
<p>Alex tiptoed inside, holding her breath. The room was musty and shadowy. Then a blue light pulsed. Alex looked up, and her mouth dropped.</p>
<p>Glowing jars lined the shelves all around her. Three soul wisps pulsed inside each jar. The bobbing lights looked familiar. The blood drained from Alex’s face.</p>
<p>They were warden hearts.</p>
<p>So many jars. So many wardens had been killed.</p>
<p>Alex breathed heavily. She turned and ran out the room.</p>
<p>Alex crashed right into Reganor. Fear seized her. She scrambled to her feet and tried to dart down the hallway.</p>
<p>“Alex!” Reganor grabbed her arm. “What were you doing in there?”</p>
<p>Alex broke away. “You—you killed dozens of wardens!” she gasped.</p>
<p>“And that surprises you?” Reganor didn’t smile.</p>
<p>Alex’s blood pounded in her ears. “I thought you were afraid of wardens. You built this kingdom so you would never have to deal with one again!”</p>
<p>“I built this kingdom so everyone could live in it safely,” Reganor whispered. “But nothing will be truly safe until all the wardens are destroyed.”</p>
<p>Alex stepped back. “But most wardens mind their own business. They don’t leave the deep dark.”</p>
<p>Alex stared at Reganor’s stony face. “You just want revenge.”</p>
<p>Reganor smiled. It was the first time he had smiled since Alex had met him, and it was <em>not</em> a comforting sight.</p>
<p>Reganor flicked dust off his cape. “You know the saying, Alex. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.” He shook his head. “The wardens destroyed my home, everything and everyone that I loved.”</p>
<p>Reganor tapped the hilt of his sword. “But once Steve helps me open the warden’s portal, I can make them pay.” He smiled. “I’ll destroy the <em>wardens’</em> home. I’ll destroy their whole dimension.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just wrong!” cried Alex. “What if there are friendly creatures in the sculk dimension?”</p>
<p>“Oh, please,” said Reganor. “The sculk life cycle is based on death and decay. Everything on the other side of the portal deserves to die.”</p>
<p>“Steve would never let you destroy a whole world. I’ll tell him! I’ll tell him you’re not the friend he remembers!” said Alex.</p>
<p>Reganor chuckled. “You’re right. I’m not. But I know you won’t tell him anything about our little late night talk.”</p>
<p>Alex gripped her sword.</p>
<p>“Do you know how I know?” asked Reganor. “Because you want to open the portal as much as I do. We need to find a cure for Steve.”</p>
<p>The blue glow from the secret closet glinted off Reganor’s face. Alex lowered her head.</p>
<p>“If you stop me from opening the portal, if you spare the wardens…it’s Steve who will die,” Reganor whispered. “It’s your choice.”</p>
